Telecom Churn Case Study using ML algorithms


The predictive model that has been built will serve two purposes:

1) It will help us predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc.

2) It will help us identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.
